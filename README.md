This system is based on a previous application developed for G4S Greece, where the system was analyzed and the user interface was designed by us, using the following analysis techniques:
- **Rich Picture**: Visual representation of system processes and interactions.
- **Use Case Analysis/Diagram**: Identification of system interactions and user requirements.
- **CATWOE Analysis**: Analysis tool for system and stakeholder perspectives.
- **UML Class Diagram**: Detailed design of the system structure and data model.
